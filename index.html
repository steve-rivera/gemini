        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class='question'>
          <strong>How do the credit card rewards work?</strong>
          <p>
            With the extra20SM credit card , you can get paid for your everday spending. You spend $400, we pay you $10 per month. Then, you get another $10 per month when you spend another $400. That’s a total of $20 a month that we credit back to you.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class='question'>
          <strong>Is this just a one-time promotion?</strong>
          <p>
            This will not be a one-time promotion. We plan to give a monthly bonus for our extra20SM credit card customers. There’s no cap on how long you can collect your $20 per month as long as you qualify. The bonus is credited directly to your monthly bill.
